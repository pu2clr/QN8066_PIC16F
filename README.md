# QN8066 FM TRANSMITTER WITH PIC16F876A


This projeto is intended to provide an easy-to-use interface for controlling the QN8066 FM transceiver using the PIC16F876A.

The primary goal of this project for the QN8066 is to simplify the development of robust applications using this device. I hope that hobbyists, electronics technicians, radio amateurs, and others interested in this work will find success in their projects.
